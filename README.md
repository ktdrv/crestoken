# CRESToken
#### A CREST Auth Token Getter

A simple tool that allows you to get EVE CREST authorization tokens and use them to access authenicated-only API items such as market orders.

If you are going to hammer the API server with a lot of requests, please [create a new SSO application](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications/create) at the developers website and use that client ID instead of the default value.
